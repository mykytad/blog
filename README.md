My first project on Rails.

Here I get to know Rails and its capabilities.

I got acquainted with the MVC, and REST pattern, and worked with MySQL database.

I wrote my first test on Rspec and set my first CI on gitlab

We are gonna deploy the app with https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/blob/master/README.md

We are using this tutorial https://blog.appsignal.com/2022/07/13/deploy-your-ruby-on-rails-app-using-capistrano.html
